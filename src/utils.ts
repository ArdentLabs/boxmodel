 *  - One to Many
 *  - Many to Many
 *
 * We need a way to reliably choose which parent gets choosen for operations.
 * This function does exactly that.
 *
 * If the relationship is One-to-Many or Many-to-Many, a closure is returned
 * since we need more information. Specifically, we need the URL parameters.
 *
 * If the relationship is One-to-One, there is only one parent, so the parent
